# My dev learnings notes

## Introduction

As I am new to the whole cloud ops world as well as understanding the fact that I can *REALLY* learn only by doing, I am keeping my learnings and notes on my github.

## Objective

I am hoping to learn and get used to the following skills by leaving my dev-journey on github:
- markdown syntax
- git commands

Not only that, I would be building a real profile on github!
